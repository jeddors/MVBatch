# MVBatch
A novel graphical user-friendly interface for process understanding, optimization and process monitoring
has been developed as a freely available MATLAB toolbox. The main contribution of this software package
is the integration of the recent developments in Batch Multivariate Statistical Process Control that over-
come problems such as the different sampling policy among variables and batches, complex asynchronisms
and time-varying correlation structures.  Apart from providing the algorithms in MATLAB format for its
manipulation in the light of future research by the scientic community, an interface that guides users to
handle batch data through the main modeling steps (data alignment, preprocessing, transformation of the
three-way array into a two-way array, and calibration) is provided.  In addition, a simulator of the fermen-
tation process of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultivation is available to generate realistic batch data under
normal and abnormal operating conditions
