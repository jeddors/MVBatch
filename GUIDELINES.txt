The MVBatch toolbox is a graphical user-friendly interface for process understanding, troubleshooting and monitoring. The analysis is performed by following the main steps of the bilinear modeling cycle: from the equalization and synchronization of batch trajectories, to the calibration of latent variable models based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and monitoring of historical batches. In the market, there exist commercial software packages addressing these modeling steps from different perspectives, such as ProMV Batch by ProSensus, Unscrambler X Batch Modeling by CAMO and SIMCA by MSK. The intention of this toolbox is not to replace these standard tools, but proving the scientific committee with the most recent analytical solutions that overcome limitations of methods already available. Besides, the MVBatch Toolbox has been designed and implemented as a free software package to enable the generation of new ideas in the scientific community. Contributions, additions and improvements from the chemoetric comminuty is encouraged. 

The MVBatch toolbox integrates the most recent developments with the well-known techniques for batch data equalization, synchronization, calibration and monitoring.

2) Execution of the MVBatch Toolbox


There are two ways to work with the MVbatch Toolbox: using the graphical user interface (GUI) for starting users and using the command line for expert users.The main GUI is self-explanatory and follows the modeling cycle of batch processes: alignment, preprocessing, transformation of the three-way array into a two-way array and calibration, and monitoring. It incorporates help messages to guide its use. To launch the main GUI, type "MVBatch" in the command line of Matlab after the installation, as explained in the README.txt document. 

To start, the user will have to load a data set following the data structure explained in the user manual. To enable the creation of data files that MVBatch can read, the user can use the function "BuildDataBase.m". This function receives as inputs: i) a cell array, where in each cell data for a single batch is stored, a cell array with the batch ID, and a cell array containing the variable names.  

The Matlab function provide includes helping information, that can be seen by typing "help <command>" in the command line of Matlab. This helping information includes examples.
